# WHAT IS THIS?

This is a very simple, HTML- and jQuery-based Fair Use Analysis tool created for Emerson College. This was a collaboration between Information Technology, the Instructional Technology Group, the Library, and Media Services. It is an attempt at addressing a critical issue for media usage in educational settings: how do we stick within the guidelines of Fair Use? This is especially difficult when sharing content online.

# How do I use it?

Clone it, change some of the proper nouns, and tell people about it.
