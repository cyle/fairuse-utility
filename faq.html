<h3>Fair Use - Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div class="alert-box alert">Please be aware that <b>this is not legal advice</b>.</div>

<p class="question">I want to show a full-length feature film to students in my classroom.  Do I need to seek permission from the copyright holder before I do this?</p>

<p>Section 110 of the Copyright Act (1976) allows you to screen a full-length feature film to your students in a face-to-face teaching situation as part of a regular course of instruction without seeking permission from the copyright holder.</p>

<p class="question">I want to show clips from a movie to students during my classroom presentation and I also want to post these clips on <a href="http://median.emerson.edu/" target="_blank">Median</a> so that they can have access to them for further review and study.</p>

<p>The TEACH Act allows for the performance of a "reasonable and limited amount" of a motion picture as part of the systematic mediated instructional activities of an accredited nonprofit educational institution, providing that a number of conditions and requirements have been previously met by the institution.  One condition is that the clips be accessible only to students in the course, so be sure to check off the "Class Only" restriction for the entry in Median. A full list of the conditions and requirement may be found by following this link North Carolina State University Libraries' TEACH Toolkit: <a href="http://www.provost.ncsu.edu/copyright/toolkit/" target="_blank">http://www.provost.ncsu.edu/copyright/toolkit/</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, a 2006 exception to the Digital Millennium Copy Right Act of 1998 allows "media studies or film professors" to circumvent DRM software in the course of creating these clips, providing that the film does not already exist in digitial format. However, this exception is scheduled to expire in July 2013, see: <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Does it matter if the videos that I show in class or use to make the clips come from the library collection or from my own personal collection?</p>

<p>The most important requirement is that your copy of the film has been "lawfully made or acquired" (Section 110 (1)) or "legally acquired" (TEACH ACT).   You should not use a copy that was not legally purchased from an authorized vendor or borrowed from a library or legitimate commercial operation.</p>

<p class="question">Can I digitize a full-length film or video and make it available via streaming media to my students enrolled in my class, so I don't have to dedicate limited classroom time to a screening?</p>

<p>Many people in academia and in business would like to have a definitive answer to that question. Unfortunately, a definitive answer does not exist at the present time.  Instead, when it comes to streaming more than a "limited and reasonable amount" of a film, even when access is restricted to students enrolled in your course, each proposed use of this kind should be carefully analyzed according to the four factors identified under Fair Use in Section 107 of the Copyright Act: <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html</a></p>

<p>Some institutions provide a checklist to assist faculty members in their fair use analysis.  The following sample analysis, based on a form used at Cornell University, illustrates the specific factors to be considered and judgment calls involved when conducting a fair use analysis.  Briefly,  the first factor, Purpose of the Use, weighs in favor of fair use when the film is being used  as an integral part of your course curriculum; the second factor, Nature of the Copyrighted Materials weighs against fair use as feature films are widely considered to be creative work; the third factor, Amount Copied, weighs against fair use if a large portion or the entire work is being streamed (or if the amount used is considered to be essential or the heart of the work); the fourth factor, Effect on the Market for the Original, will also weigh against fair use if streaming rights can be licensed through Swank's Digital Campus, Cinema Guild, Criterion or one of the many other organizations who are currently marketing streaming rights for feature films</p>

<p class="question">Can I make a DVD copy of a VHS tape? </p>

<p>Not unless the title you have is no longer available for purchase, or not available at a fair market price.  If you have determined that the title is unavailable, and at physical risk, or in an obsolete format, like Umatic tape, you may be able to go ahead and migrate formats.  Note, however, that the requirements for use of replacement copies under 108 is narrowly defined. Please check <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#108" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#108</a> and <a href="http://www.librarycopyright.net/108spinner/" target="_blank">http://www.librarycopyright.net/108spinner/</a></p>

<p class="question">Can I transfer a PAL tape to an NTSC tape, so I can use it in class?</p>

<p>No, because transferring a work from one format to another is technically what the copyright law considers "derivation" -- one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder.  Format transfers are only allowable under provisions of Section 108 of the copyright law (which has to do with making copies of works in obsolete formats, or legally acquired works which are at physical risk and which can no longer be purchased at fair market prices).</p>

<p>The short answer is you can't transfer from PAL to NTSC (US standard), or from tape to DVD if the work in question is under copyright and still available for purchase in ANY format.</p>

<p class="question">I have a question that is not answered here. Who should I contact?</p>

<p>Feel free to contact the library copyright team (<a href="mailto:copyright@emerson.edu">copyright@emerson.edu</a>), ITG (<a href="mailto:itg@emerson.edu">itg@emerson.edu</a>), or Bob Fleming directly (<a href="mailto:robert_fleming@emerson.edu">robert_fleming@emerson.edu</a>) with any Fair Use questions.</p>
